Installation
------------

	* installation should be as simple of possible. I am ready to pay a small overhead on the welcome page to check that the installation has been already been done and do it automatically if it has not.

	* Wordress has a very simple installation procedure, let's steal as many ideas as possible.

	* https://fr.wordpress.org/txt-install/


Check to perform on the welcome page

	if it is not possible to connect to the database
		display error message
			- mysql may be down
			- incorrect credential to connect
		exit
	endif

	# connected to the database

	# check schema
	if (schema is not install) then
		create the tables
		fill the startup data
		display information that it was the initial install
		and explain how to connect
	else
		display login page
	endif

Instructions:

	1) download GVV and put it in your web server directory
	   * download citemplate
	   * download gvv
	   * merge them
	2) Create a MYSQL database and a user to access it
	3) Edit the application/config/database.php and change it according to your database user.
	4) edit application/config/config.php and 
		adapt the base_url address
		chose your language $config['language']
		encryption_key (at some point https://flub78.ddns.net/encryption_key)
	5) ouvrez l'URL de l'application dans un navigateur WEB.
	   L'application va détecter que la base n'existe pas et la créer.
