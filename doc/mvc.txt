Model, Vue, Controller

    Some conventions on MVC. 
    
    Table managements:
    
    1) the model->select_all method returns a list of hash.
    
    2) The metadata datatable:
        - add the header line
        - select the colomns
        - add the actions, checkbox selector, edit, delete
        - return a 2 dimentional array (array of array)
        
    3) the CodeIgniter table library should turn this array into an HTML table
    
    
    Questions & Answers
    
    * In metadata programming where should I put the fields validation rules?
    
    In basic CI application, they are usually in the controllers. With metadata programming, somes of the rules
    are implied by the metadata type. So it is logical to have a rules($table, $field) in the metadata helper.
    However is is more flexible to keep the rues setting in the controllers (to add business rules).
    
    * Should I try to keep all data validation inside the model like on RoR?
    
    Advantage of this approach is that is that there is no way to insert incoherent data in the database.
    
    * Is it judicious to consider two data validation levels ?
        1) one form validation, just to check the syntax
        2) business rules validation
        
    The first one could be enforced on the client by javascript. In all cases, all data validation must be
    also done at the server levle for security reasons.
