REST API

Why:
----

    Convenient API for others programs
    
    Server for tablet or phone applications
    
    If the application model is a REST API, it becomes easier to switch
    form one data server to another.
    
What:
-----

    https://your.domain/Api/Resourcename
    
    We are going to focus on json API (most widely used and groing)
    
    
    GET /task       retreive a list of tasks
    
    GET /task/12    retrieve the task 12
    
    POST /task      create a new task
    
    PUT/ /task/12   uptadte task 12
    
    DELETE /task/12 delete task 12
    
    DELETE /task    delete all tasks
    
    
    Maps the relationship
    ----------------------
    
    GET /task/21/comments   retreive all comments for task 21
    
    GET /task/21/cmments/5  retreive comment 5 of task 21
    
    
    Search & filters
    ----------------
    GET /tasks?sort=-priority
    
    Sort by priority descending order
    
    GET /tasks?sort=-priority,created_at 
    Sort by priority descending order and creation date
    
    Possibility to create aliases for convenience
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    GET /tasks?status=completed
    
    Get /tasks/completed
    
    Get /pilots/?age<25
    
    GET /pilots/less_25
    
    Select fields
    -------------
    
    GET /tasks?fields=id,title,updated_at
    
    Pagination
    ----------
    
    GET /notification?page=1&per_page=50
    
    Return full resource after action
    ----------------------------------
    
    For efficiency the full resource must be returned after 
    a PUT, POST, or PATCH in addition of other status, error message, etc.
    
    Error messages
    --------------
    
    400: client issue
    500: server issue
    
    {"code": 1234,
     "message": "task field validation failed",
     "context" "Date is not set"
    }
    
    
    Authentication
    --------------
    
        consumer request token
        
        service provider grants request token
        
    The REST API must be documented online
