The goal of the project is to provide an application template from which real application
can be derived really fast.

Features:

    * Database
        - backup
        - restore
        - migration
    * Authentication (using ciauth) http://ciauth.com/
        - login/logout
        - privileges management
        - register
        - forgotten password
        - control maximal number of attempts
        - ciauth has not been updated since July 29 2015. I should consider something else.
