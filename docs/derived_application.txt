CITEMPLATE applications
=======================

Citemplate is supposed to contains the components common to several applications.

@startuml
class Citemplate {
  
}

class GVV3 {
  
}
Citemplate *--  GVV3 : is_based_on
Citemplate "1" *-- "many" Applications : is_based_on

So it is more convenient to manage them as separate projects.

It is recommended that each application maintain its component in specific sub directories

controller/application1/
helpers/application1/
libraires/application1/

During the integration/bild process the two directories structure are merged to create the CodeIgniter structure and one file exists both in citemplate and the application, the application file overwrite the citemplate one.

It is slightly complex, but it is the only way that I have found to minimize the redundencay between citempalte and its applications.
