Database default model
======================

By default citemplate includes:

The tables for authentication
    * groups
    * login_attemp
    * users
    * users_groups
    
and their views
    * users_groups_views
    * user_views

It also include the table for database migration "migration"

and two examples
    * meta_test1 
    * meta_test2
    
Note: better to name the views view_ to get them at the end by alphabetical order


Installation
------------

    When no tables exist in the database
    * the script intall/database.sql is executed
    * then migration are executed.
        It is recommended to install everything from migrations
        
    * then the initial user is created
