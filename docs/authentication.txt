Citemplate authentication

	Initially authentication has been done with ciauth.
	https://github.com/barnent1/ciauth

	Ciauth provides an authentication mechanism, a template mechanism and a navigation mechanism. The authentication is not bad,
	but is the group management is not complete. The project looks dead last update in july 2015.

	So I am going to look for another authentication library.

	ion_auth looks more active and it is only an authentication mechanism.
