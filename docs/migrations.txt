Installation and Migrations


Use cases:

    * Initial installation:
    
    as an administrator I want to start the program for the first time and
    that it creates the tables and fill them with a minimal set of data.
    (for example a default user so I can log on).
    
    When some data are mandatory for the program to work, they must be filled.
    (for example if the admin privileges is used in the program).
    
    Note that initial installation can be automated (if no tables are
    detected at startup). In this case it should do nothing if any table
    is detected. And the reset mechanism should be protected by the
    admin prvileges and ask for confirmation.
    
    
    * Reset
    
    as an administrator, I want to be able to bring back the databse in 
    the factory configuration (empty)
    
    * Migration
    
    as an administrator I want to be able to update the database to highest
    database structure supported by the program. I also want to be able
    to use any lower value.
    
    * Migration from GVV
    
    Is it a special case ? The migration to a full application database can
    be the second migration of the application (if the first one is the one that set the
    defaults).
    
    * No automatic migration
    
    If the user want to stick to one migration level on purpose, better to not prompt him each time that
    he logs on.
